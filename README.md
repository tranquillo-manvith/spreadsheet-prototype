React Intern Assignment
Join us in building the next generation of AI-powered solutions‚Äî designed to scale impact,
spark innovation, and move the world forward.

# 1. Goal

Create a static, front-end-only React prototype that visually matches the attached screenshot
of the product‚Äôs spreadsheet view.

# 2. Core Criteria (IMPORTANT)

Build a pixel perfect experience as per Figma (including the actual spreadsheet experience) in
ReactFigma URL:
https://www.figma.com/design/3nywpu5sz45RrCmwe68QZP/Intern-Design-Assigment?node-id=2-2535&t=DJGGMt8I4fiZjoIB-1

# 3. Tech Stack

- React 18 (Vite or CRA‚Äîyour choice)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS for utility styling (already used across Gob)
- react-table (or ‚ö°your own minimal table component) for the grid
- No state management library needed‚Äîlocal component state is fine.

# 5. Acceptance Criteria

1. Pixel-close layout to the Figma.
2. Google Sheet/Excel like spread sheet experience
3. All buttons/tabs change state or log to console‚Äîno dead UI.
4. Code passes npm run lint (ESLint + Prettier) and npm run type-check.
5. Clean commit history with meaningful messages.
6. Stretch (optional, only if time permits)
   - Keyboard navigation within the grid (arrow keys).
   - Column resize / hide toggles.
7. Submission
   - Live URL to access the built out product
   - Github
   - Include a short README.md explaining setup & any trade-offs.
     Good luck and have fun üêô
